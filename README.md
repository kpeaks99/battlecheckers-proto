#Battlecheckers
Welcome to Battlecheckers!

Our purpose is to provide a fun space for people to come together and play checkers.

This is a web based app written in Javascript with React, node.js, socket.io, axios, sequalize.

For new users, begin by registering, then logging into your account. 
Once logged in, you can start a match and play against a friend or a stranger. 
After the match, you can check your new stats or check the leaderboards to see how other players are doing. 

This project was created for Rowan University during the Senior Project Fall 22.
